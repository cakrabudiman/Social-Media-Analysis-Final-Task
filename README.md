# Social-Media-Analysis-Final-Task
This project focuses on analyzing social network interactions related to renewable energy policy discussions on Platform X (Twitter). The objective is to identify community structures, influential users, and discussion dynamics using graph-based and data-driven approaches.

Data was collected through API-based crawling, resulting in more than 1,600 user interactions, including posts, replies, retweets, and mentions. The dataset underwent preprocessing stages such as data cleaning, text normalization, lemmatization, and stopword removal to ensure analytical quality.

The analysis applies node-centric and group-centric methods, utilizing centrality metrics (degree, betweenness, closeness, and eigenvector) to identify key actors within the network. Community detection techniques such as modularity and label propagation were implemented to uncover tightly connected groups, followed by dynamic community analysis to observe how discussions evolved over time.

The results are visualized using network graphs to provide intuitive insights into information diffusion, community influence, and public discourse patterns related to energy transition topics.
